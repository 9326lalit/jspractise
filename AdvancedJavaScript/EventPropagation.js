// Event propagation refers to the process of how events propagate or travel
// trough DOM(Document Object Model) hierarchy.
// In JS,there are two phases of event propagation:capturing phase and bubbling phase.
// Capturing Phase:: The event starts from the root of the DOM and goes down to the target element.
// Bubbling Phase:: The event starts from the target element bubbles up to the root of the DOM.
